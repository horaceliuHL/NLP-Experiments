Key points about my music QA system: 

1. Runs using BERT Transformer with question and passage 

2. Attempted to use GPT as well as bert-large-uncased but ran into GPU issues

3. Uses max rounded value (integer) as predictions where <= 0 is 0 and >= 1 is 1 

4. Uses 5 epochs with 0.01 weight decay and 0.2 learning rate 

Accuracy for GRU is: 0.7176470588235294


Accuracy for passage-only transformer is: 0.7176470588235294
